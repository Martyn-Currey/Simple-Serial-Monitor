# Simple-Serial-Monitor

Simple Serial Monitor is yet another stand alone replacement for the Arduino serial monitor. It is text only and is far from being a fully fledged terminal app. It does have a couple of features that make it a little better than the regular Arduino serial monitor, especially when used with UART modules like the Bluetooth modules I often play with.

Simple Serial Monitor was created as an example of using the serial port in Visual Basic NET. The app is written in Visual Basic.NET (Framework) and uses .NET 4.8. NET 4.8 is an older version of .NET that has drag & drop serial ports in the designer making serial ports a little easier to implement.
